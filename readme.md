Just run `fitting.py` with python, only works with python3. 

Requires scipy, numpy 

The `fitting` script has the fitting code.
The `rotation` script implements the rotations. See for yourself that any rotations, `U`, it makes satisfy `UU^T=I`
The `points` script just keeps the point-loading code in its own little spot.
